# Tribute-page
on my second day of learning coding with HTML and CSS

## Live Site
[See live on netlify] - https://tribute-pages-1.netlify.app/

## Features
Decent Mobile compatibility.
Teleport to different section.
Link to other website

## Built With
HTML5 - improvement over the last one with more styling and usage of list/fieldset/address
CSS3 - huge improvement in style in my opinion with color matching but not in a sad emotion more of a nice ocean like style with box shadow and border adjustment.

## Attempt
time = aproximently 5 hour~.
ideas = connected this with my survey form story, and did a little planning but was still not planning much, mainly focus on the styling.
